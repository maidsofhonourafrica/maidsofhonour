```

### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate JWT secret and encryption key
openssl rand -base64 32  # Add to .env as JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32     # Add to .env as ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY

# Set up database
npm run db:push

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Mobile App Setup

```bash
cd mobileapp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Expo
npx expo start
